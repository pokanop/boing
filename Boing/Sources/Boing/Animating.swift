/// Animating protocol for providing rich animation methods to the user interface.
///
/// Provides convenience API to trigger animations including basic animation types
/// like `scale` or `translate` and presets that do more interesting things like
/// `morph` or `boing`. The interface also provides facilities for composing
/// several animations together.
///
/// All methods return an `AnimatingContext` which can be used to build and
/// sequence more animations easily. A complete example may look like:
///
///     view
///         .scale(x: 1.2, y: 1.2)
///         .flip(direction: .left)
///         .boing()
///
/// Both `UIView` and `AnimatingContext` are extended to conform to this protocol.
public protocol Animating {

    ///
    /// The `animate` method builds a single `AnimatingContext` that allows options to
    /// be configured for the `AnimatingType` values that were provided. These options include
    /// properties like `duration` or `delay` which apply on the set of animations in this context.
    ///
